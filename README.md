OldScape is an emulator project that simulates the Oldschool Runescape server. The goal of the project is to closely
emulated the server and improve it whenever possible. OldScape puts an emphasis on ease of use for content developers.

## How To setup

To setup this project properly a cache has to be present under `cache/src/main/resources/cache`. To support player 
saving PostgreSQL needs to be installed with a configuration that matches `server/world/main/resources/Config.yaml`.
